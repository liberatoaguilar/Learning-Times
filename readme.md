# Learning Times Collection

This is a collection of code snippits that are too simple for their own repo, but that I am still proud of. They are mostly simple programs that I have created over the years since I began programming in 2016. These are not meant to showcase skillful programming or anything, they are just a personal reminder of how far I have come. I specifically picked these from hundreds of other programs in my computer because they do have some purpose, or at least they did at one point. Enjoy :)

## 2016

### Calc.py

- This program takes in two numbers and can add, subtract, multiply, divide, percent increase/decrease, and convert the number to binary.
- The variable names are very confusing.
- One of my first times using functions.

### Chopped.py

- Use your imagination to create a dish based on the ingredients that are provided to you by the computer!
- One of my first introductions into random numbers and choices.

### Game.py

- Extremely simple game concept. Asks for your name and weapon of choice then lays out a board that shows where the player is currently standing on the map. It asks if you want to open your pack, which contains your weapon of choice.
- This is the idea behind my most recent game Map (https://github.com/liberatoaguilar/Map).

### lcr.py

- Simulator for the board game Left Center Right.
- Simulates a game on a 3x3 board with the middle empty, resulting in 8 "players"
- My code begins to show some improvement in quality

### Riddle.py

- Inspired by Einstein's Riddle, this program asks for 5 people, colors, drinks, sports, and food, which are then used in the riddle.
- This was one of my very first programs.
- It was typed completely on a mobile phone.
- No functions were used.

## 2017

### Encrypt.py/Decrypt.py

- These programs go hand in hand as one is used to Encrypt a file and the other to decrypt it.
- It prompts the user to type a letter to replace another letter in the alphabet and then a key is given that will be used in decrypting.
- This was my first time using file readers/writers in Python.

### Google.py

- One of my first tkinter GUI projects.
- Google.py is a widget that just has a search bar and a search button that searches google for anything typed.

### Pomodoro.py

- Another tkinter project that was developed to help me focus.
- The pomodoro method consists of working for a certain amount of time (25 mins for me) and taking either a long (10 min) or short (5 min) break. This repeats for 4 periods.
- A song is supposed to play in the background during the timing period and the computer says "Break Finished" after each break.
- I was playing around with the "os" Python package.

### Timer.py

- Timer.py is pretty much self-explanatory. It is a simple timer app (in minutes).
- This is also a tkinter GUI project that also uses the "os" package.
- The code is somewhat of a base for pomodoro.py.
- The app makes a sound and quits after it is done.

### SpeedRead.py

- Precursor to the SpeedRead app (https://github.com/liberatoaguilar/SpeedRead).
- Tkinter and Python.
- This does not have all the features as the Swift version but it served as a base.
- The user enters a file path and the files contents are shown rapidly.
- Works best on plain text files.

### Motivation.py

- One of my first web-scraping projects with BeautifulSoup.
- Took motivational quotes from the website motivationalquotes101.com, which is sadly no longer in use, rendering this app useless.
- An image of what it looked like in 2017 is shown below.

### Stocks.py/Stockex.py

- Stocks.py was an introduction into using Classes in Python.
- It uses BeautifulSoup to webscrape marketwatch.com and gather information about a given stock.
- This program no longer works because marketwatch.com now has captcha requirements.
- Stockex.py is the example GUI usage of Stocks.py with the "amzn" stock.

## 2018

### Notes.py

- A simple note-taking app that I created to be able to use in school.
- Supports markdown (H1, H2, H3, Bold, bullets).
- First time using key bindings in a tkinter app (Command-i to toggle markdown).

## 2020

### Gnome.py

- I decided to learn about AI basics, and gnome.py was an introduction into genetic algorithms.

### Heart.js

- Finally a transition from Python in this collection.
- I wrote this after learning JS from the EloquentJavaScript book.
- This program takes in a string and generates an ASCII heart from that string.
- Ex:

### Regexp.js

- This JavaScript project takes in any amount of files or directories and tests each file recursively for a given regular expression.
- Regexp.js is a solution I came up with to one of the exercises in EloquentJavaScript, and it has been a very useful tool to me.

## Conclusion

Many of these programs are not very well written and some don't even work anymore. However, despite them not working, I enjoy looking over them simply for the memories of when I was barely learning how to code and it shows how far I have come. From Riddle.py which was written on a mobile phone to Regexp.js which uses recursive functions and regular expressions, the path of improvement is clear. These programs will always hold a special place in my heart and that is why I believe they deserve some recognition on my github so others can possibly learn from them.
